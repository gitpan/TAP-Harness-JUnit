This is TAP::Harness::JUnit module.

It provides a test harness that runs TAP tests and outputs
JUnit-compatible XML.

Before building it yourself, you may prefer to fetch the package from your
Operating System distribution, if one exists. Here's how would you install
it in Fedora:

# yum -y install 'perl(TAP::Harness::JUnit)'

Otherwise, follow the usual Module::Build convention:

$ perl Build.pl
# ./Build
# ./Build install

The build script will issue a warning when any of required modules is
missing or wrong version.

See the POD documentation for more information (on how to use the module,
licensing, copyright, etc.):

$ perldoc TAP::Harness::JUnit

Before installing the module, you can do:

$ perldoc lib/TAP/Harness/JUnit.pm
